RentProX – Property Management System
RentProX is a web-based property management system designed to digitalize long-term rental operations between property owners, tenants, and administrators.
The system focuses on managing the complete post-listing rental lifecycle, including rent tracking, maintenance handling, and role-based dashboards.

Project Overview
Traditional rental management often relies on manual records, spreadsheets, and informal communication methods, leading to inefficiency and disputes.
RentProX provides a centralized digital platform that replaces these manual processes with structured workflows and verified records.

The system enables:

Property owners to manage listings, rent records, and maintenance requests

Tenants to view rent history, submit maintenance requests, and track payments

Administrators to control onboarding, access permissions, and system monitoring

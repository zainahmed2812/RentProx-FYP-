RentProX – Property Management System
RentProX is a web-based property management system designed to digitalize long-term rental operations between property owners, tenants, and administrators.
The system focuses on managing the complete post-listing rental lifecycle, including rent tracking, maintenance handling, and role-based dashboards.

Project Overview
Traditional rental management often relies on manual records, spreadsheets, and informal communication methods, leading to inefficiency and disputes.
RentProX provides a centralized digital platform that replaces these manual processes with structured workflows and verified records.

The system enables:

Property owners to manage listings, rent records, and maintenance requests
Tenants to view rent history, submit maintenance requests, and track payments
Administrators to control onboarding, access permissions, and system monitoring



System Architecture
RentProX follows a layered architecture:
Frontend Layer: User interfaces for Admin, Owner, and Tenant dashboards
Backend Layer: Business logic, APIs, and authentication services
Database Layer: Relational SQL database for persistent data storage
The system uses a modular and incremental development approach to ensure scalability and maintainability.
